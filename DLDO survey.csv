0.5-V input digital LDO with 98.7% current efficiency and 2.7-µA quiescent current in 65nm CMOS,"Yasuyuki Okuma, Koichi Ishida, Yoshikatsu Ryu, Xin Zhang, Po-Hung Chen, Kazunori Watanabe, Makoto Takamiya, and Takayasu Sakurai","Digital LDO is proposed to provide the low noise and tunable power supply voltage to the 0.5-V near-threshold logic circuits. Because the conventional LDO feedback-controlled by the operational amplifier fail to operate at 0.5V, the digital LDO eliminates all analog circuits and is controlled by digital circuits, which enables the 0.5-V operation. The developed digital LDO in 65nm CMOS achieved the 0.5-V input voltage and 0.45-V output voltage with 98.7% current efficiency and 2.7-µA quiescent current at 200-µA load current.

"Dual-loop system of distributed microregulators with high DC accuracy, load response time below 500 ps, and 85-mV dropout voltage",J. Bulzacchelli et al.,"A dual-loop architecture employs eight distributed microregulators (UREGs) to achieve load response times below 500 ps in 45-nm SOI CMOS. The trip point of an asynchronous comparator inside each UREG is tuned for high DC accuracy with a local charge pump, which receives UP/DOWN currents from a slow outer feedback loop. The feedback through the charge pumps also ensures balanced load sharing among the UREGs. Two techniques are introduced to reduce the output ripple generated by switching the pMOS passgate on and off: hybrid fast/slow passgate control (in which the DC portion of the load current is supplied by a parallel output device with slew-rate-limited gate drive) and pMOS strength calibration (which adjusts the active width of the passgate to compensate for PVT variations). The distributed regulator system is integrated into a DDR3 I/O core and supplies power to CMOS delay lines used for clock-to-data deskewing. Each of the eight UREGs is sized to provide up to 5.3 mA of load current and occupies an area of 55 × 60 ?m 2 . The measured DC load regulation is better than 10 mV down to an 85-mV dropout voltage.

A 0.45-to-1.2-V fully digital low-dropout voltage regulator with fast-transient controller for near/subthreshold circuits,Y. Li et al.,"A low quiescent current digital low-dropout (DLDO) voltage regulator with fast-transient response time is proposed for self-powered wireless sensor applications operating at near/subthreshold supply voltage. The D-LDO regulator incorporates both hill-climbing and binary search algorithms (HCBS) in the control logic, thus leveraging on each other's strengths to minimize the output voltage's ripple and the quiescent current during the steady-state period as well as output voltage's spike and response time during the transition period.

A Fully Integrated Digital Low-Dropout Regulator Based on Event-Driven Explicit Time-Coding Architecture,D. Kim et al.,"his paper presents a fully integrated digital low-dropout (LDO) voltage regulator based on event-driven control architecture. The focus of the paper is to scale the off-chip output capacitor of an LDO conventionally used to compensate fast load current change. To shrink the output capacitor size, it is paramount to shorten control latency. This can be done by employing a high-speed error amplifier in analog LDO designs and by using fast clock in digital synchronous LDO designs. However, those approaches become less suitable for sub-1-V supply voltage due to the headroom problem of analog circuits and/or increase power dissipation due to the high-frequency clock. In this paper, we tackle the tradeoff between power consumption and control latency by introducing an event-driven approach. Our event-driven approach enables to perform regulation tasks only when the output voltage deviates significantly from a set point, simultaneously achieving short latency and low-power dissipation. We prototyped an eventdriven digital LDO that supports 400-?A load current at 0.5-V input and 0.45-V output voltage.

A Sub-1V Analog-Assisted Inverter-Based Digital Low-Dropout Regulator with a Fast Response Time at 25mA/100ps and 99.4% Current Efficiency,B. Nguyen et al.,"To mitigate large voltage droop caused by sub-ns dynamic current transitions in system on chips (SoCs), this paper proposes a fully integrated analog-assisted inverter-based digital low dropout regulator (LDO) to obtain a fast response time with 160mV droop at 25mA/100ps featuring 99.4% current efficiency, and 16mV DC load regulation in sub-1V operating range by using a dynamic-step quantizer and a trip-point controller. The proposed quantizer is implemented with an inverter-based flash ADC to achieve high speed without consuming large power while the trip-point controller corrects the DC error of the inverter-based ADC. Besides, the assistant analog LDO is employed to provide fine-grain regulation and remove ripple from the output voltage.","Iq calculated from CE; reported as ripple free, but estimated from figure output ripple ~ 10mV",2019,CICC,10.1109/CICC.2019.8780173,130 nm CMOS,0.8,,,0.118,1,0.8,0.2,160,140,26,,25,0.1,280,250,157,99.4,79.52,,,, ~ 10 mV,,,,,0.615,220.3389831,32.1536,1.0048,32.4676,0.81169
"An Analog-Proportional Digital-Integral Multi-Loop Digital LDO with Fast Reponse, Improved PSR and Zero Minimum Load Current”",M. Huang et al.,"This work presents a multi-loop digital low dropout regulator (DLDO), with analog-proportional (AP) and digital-integral (DI) controls. The DI part is implemented with shift-register-based coarse-fine tuning for good output DC accuracy and fast recovery. Meanwhile, the AP part, based on an improved low-supply flipped-voltage-follower (FVF), can response fast to the load step and supply ripple. A replica loop is used to adaptively control the AP current for a sufficient dynamic current to against supply ripple, and thus further enhances the power supply rejection (PSR). When the load current is smaller than the digital least significant bit (LSB) current, the AP part takes over the LDO control. In such case, the limit cycle oscillation (LCO) is eliminated, and no longer limits the minimum load current to be zero.

Time-Based Digital LDO Regulator with Fractionally Controlled Power Transistor Strength and Fast Transient Response,J. Kang et al.,"The number of enabled power transistors and their ON-time of a digital low-dropout (LDO) regulator are controlled by a time-based controller. By the time-based controller consisting of two voltage-controlled oscillators (VCO) and a phase-detecting switch driver, the effective number of enabled power transistors and therefore their strength can be fractionally controlled. The transient response is greatly improved by a transient detector which selectively disables one of the two VCOs during a transient condition. At steady state, the number of switching power transistor is either zero or one, minimizing the ripple of the output voltage. Implemented in a 65 nm CMOS technology, the time-based digital LDO regulator can provide 0.5 ~ 1.1V output from 0.9 ~ 1.2V input. For the maximum load current of 19 mA, the peak current efficiency is 99.3 %.

A Fully Synthesizable Distributed and Scalable All-Digital LDO in 10nm CMOS,S. Bang et al.,"Integrated LDOs cost-effectively enable fine-grain voltage regulation for digital IP blocks. A distributed LDO architecture, where a number of dispersed LDO units supply a single domain with shared power delivery network (PDN), has been recently proposed for point-of-load regulation improving both local IR-drop and transient droop response across the IP domain [1]-[3]. However, previous distributed LDOs used custom communication between a global controller and local distributed LDO controllers [1], custom communication between neighboring LDO controllers [2], and/or analog voltage sensors with associated shared VREF generation and routing [1]-[3]. This paper presents a fully synthesizable, Distributed, and scalable all-Digital LDO (D-DLDO) voltage regulator (Fig. 25.1.1) with the following salient features: (1) fast single-cycle voltage monitoring using a Digital Supply-Voltage Sensor (DSVS), (2) fast digital PID-based controller, and (3) APR-friendly and tile-able design without the need to generate or route any global or inter-LDO digital/analog signals.

A 65nm Edge-Chasing Quantizer-Based Digital LDO Featuring 4.58ps-FoM and Side-Channel-Attack Resistance,Y. He et al.,"Low-Dropout Regulators (LDOs) are commonly desired for fine-grained power management in SoCs because of their compact area, high current efficiency, and small output ripple. Digital LDOs (DLDOs) are increasingly adopted in recent years thanks to voltage and process scalability. However, achieving a fast response to a load change requires a conventional synchronous DLDO to either increase its sampling frequency with a large power overhead, or include a large output capacitor (COUT) with increased chip area and cost. Various control schemes have been proposed to mitigate these drawbacks. In synchronous designs, attempts have been made to employ more complex control algorithms to achieve faster response [1], and to replace the PMOS switch array with switched capacitors for reduced dynamic energy consumption [2]. On the other hand, asynchronous DLDOs with event-driven [3] and beat-frequency VCO-based structures [4] show promise across the key performance, power and area metrics. Recently, voltage regulators are also found to be useful in enhancing the resistance of cryptographic engines and processors against power and EM side-channel attacks (SCAs) [5]-[7], which are physical attacks representing a severe threat to mobile and embedded devices. Employing regulators for SCA defense is promising because they are already used in most systems and require no modifications to existing computing architectures and algorithms like other circuit-level defenses [8]-[9]. In this paper, we present a high-performance and SCA-aware DLDO leveraging the unique properties of the Edge-Chasing Quantizer (ECQ). The 65nm DLDO prototype achieves: 1) a 101.7mV droop and 506ns settling time after a 20mA, 0.1ns step load change, with only a 0.1nF capacitor; 2) a 0.018mm2 active area and 99.4% peak current efficiency; and, 3) more than 14000× improvement in power SCA resistance on a 128b AES engine, with 27.5% area, 19.4% power, and 4.54% performance overheads over a standalone AES, and negligible overhead when compared to an AES design integrated with conventional DLDOs.",Iq = 9.8 ~ 180,2020,ISSCC,10.1109/ISSCC19947.2020.9063118,65nm LP CMOS,0.1,,0.018,0.31416,1.2,1.15,0.05,101.7,,30,,20,0.1,506,,180,99.4,95.25833333,,,,,,,,,,95.49274255,4.5765,0.079591304,5.0265,0.10053

Talele et al.,"A single low-dropout regulator (LDO) for high output current applications presents a challenge for chip-level thermal management and also tends to be inefficient. Straightforward parallelizing of LOOs to increase output current is a flawed approach since subtle variations between devices even with the state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques can cause one of the LDOs to take over the maximum current, and thus enter current limit or thermal shutdown leading to instability and loss of regulation. Parallelizing regulators [1]-[6] to share the high output current equally across each regulator while preserving regulation and stability and to spread the dissipated heat uniformly is thus a challenging design problem.","when input = 3.3V, output=3V, Vdroop=500mV, tsettle=200us; ",2020,ISSCC,10.1109/ISSCC19947.2020.9063144,180 nm CMOS,22000,32000,1.8225,,1.5,1,0.5,250,,2000,,1995,2000,200000,,-,,0,,,,,,,,,,-,-,-,-,-
